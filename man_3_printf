.SH NAME

.B _printf \- print formatted data

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B #include \fB"main.h"\fR

.B int _printf(const char *format, ...)

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B _printf()
writes output to the standard output
according to \fIformat\fR.
.TP
.B Format string

May be composed of zero or more directives: if zero, ordinary characters that are not preceded by conversion specifier (%) are directly copied to the output stream unchanged; and conversion specifications that begin with the character %, followed by a conversion specifier. When both cases are present, the printf() function starts by printing each character found in the first argument until it finds a %, and goes to the second argument, then returns to continue printing until it finds another percent and goes to the next argument in line.

\fBprintf("%c %d", name, age);\fR
.TP
.B Conversion Specifiers

Characters that specify the type of conversion with which the values will be treated:

.TP
.BR c
A type int argument is converted to a type char and written to the standard stream.
.TP
.BR s
A \fIconst char *\fR argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of characters. Characters are written up until a terminating null byte ('\n') is found.
.TP
.BR d
A type int argument is printed in its signed int format.
.TP
.BR i
A type int argument is converted to decimal notation. 
.TP
.BR b
An unsigned int argument is converted to binary.
.TP
.BR r
Prints a reversed string.
.SH RETURN VALUE
Upon successful, \fB_printf()\fR returns the number of characters printed, excluding the terminating null character.

If an output error is encountered, -1 is returned.
